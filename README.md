# The Binding of Isaac: Repentance Save Editor

A web-based save file editor for **The Binding of Isaac: Repentance** (and Repentance+), made to help you customize your progress, unlocks, and stats with ease. No ads, open-source, and privacy-respecting.

## Features

-  Load `.dat` save files directly from your computer (no upload to any server)
-  Export edited save files to re-import them into the game
-  Unlock all achievements and marks
-  Complete all challenges
-  View and edit your bestiary
-  Nothing is saved to any server

##  Save File Locations

> **Always make a backup of your save before editing.**

- **Windows**  
  `<Your Steam Directory>/userdata/<Your user id>/remote/250900/saves` or `Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Repentance`
  
- **Linux**  
  `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/250900/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Repentance`

Once you've edited your save file and placed it back in the correct folder, open the **Stats screen** in-game to make sure achievements are applied correctly (i.e sync with steam).

2. Click on **Load Save File** and select your `.dat` save.
3. Use the tab menu to browse categories (Achievements, Challenges, Bestiary, etc.).

5. Click **Export Save File** to download your modified save.
6. Replace your original save file with the new one (MAKE A BACKUP PLEASE).

## IA Disclosure
Only one thing has been made by a LLM and its the current theme. I could create a good one (see isaaconnect for the implementation of good themes. Colors of isaaconnect has been made by biobak, not me). The interface (placements, boxes, etc.) has been made by me though. Only colors, shadows, etc. is created by a LLM.
